## Create a root group 

Creating a root group is generally a good idea for any object that you may need to rescale or reposition later, even if the contents have already been animated.

In this example, the size of the artboard needs to be changed. With a root group, we can use the additional transform space it provides to reposition and rescale the candle.

Resize the Artboard

Resize the graphic using root

You'll notice that even after resizing the graphic, the animation looks exactly the same as it did before thanks to the root!
