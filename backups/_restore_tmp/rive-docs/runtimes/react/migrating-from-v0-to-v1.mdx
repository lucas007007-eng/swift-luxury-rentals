Before v1.0.0 of `rive-react`, the React runtime wrapped the `@rive-app/canvas` runtime dependency, using the backing `CanvasRenderingContext2D`. In order for the React runtime to support some upcoming advanced drawing features like Mesh Deformations, it needed to use the `@rive-app/webgl` runtime.

The major version bump to v1.0.0 involves no breaking API changes, but rather internally uses a different backing context with WebGL. If you have issues, please log them to the issues tab of the `rive-react` runtime [here](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-react/issues).
