## ðŸ¤– After Transfer - AI Agent Instructions:

Once your code is on GitHub, give an AI agent this command:

```
"Please clone the repository https://github.com/lucas007007-eng/crypto-real-estate.git
and read the instructions in src/data/ai-agent-input/README.md. 

Your mission: Extract 12 real luxury property listings over â‚¬6000/month 
for each European city (Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam, Vienna, Barcelona, London) 
from HousingAnywhere.com using the exact template format provided.

Start with Berlin, then work through each city systematically. 
Use real property images, exact titles, descriptions, and amenities 
from the actual listings.

Commit your changes for each city with descriptive messages."
